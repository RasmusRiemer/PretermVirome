# Randomization of metadata
Due to to respect patient confidentiality and to comply with European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), most metadata has been randomized. **Only Timepoint, BPD and IAP columns remain unchanged**, allowing the re-analysis of the main findings of the paper. The original R-markdown HTML output files contain the full analysis including all output figures. Full metadata is availible upon request and will require a personal data tranfer agreement.
